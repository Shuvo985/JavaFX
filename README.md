Title:
QuickQueue BD

Motivation:
Small businesses in Bangladesh struggle with messy, unorganized appointment systems. Customers waste time waiting, and business owners lose clients because of poor management. I chose this project to create a simple but powerful solution- making booking fast, organized, and stress-free for both customers and small business owners.

Project Features:

User Registration & Login: Customers and businesses can create accounts and sign in easily.

Appointment Booking: Customers can see available time slots and book appointments with a click.

Business Dashboard: Business owners can add, update, or remove available time slots and view upcoming appointments.

Real-Time Booking Status: Customers and businesses can see updates instantly (Booked, Canceled, Completed).

Appointment Notifications: Users receive confirmations and reminders for their appointments.

Appointment History: Both users and businesses can view past appointment records.

Admin Panel: Admin manages users, businesses, complaints, and overall system health.
